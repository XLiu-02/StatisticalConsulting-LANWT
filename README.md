# Call Logs Analysis for Legal Hotline at LANWT
The purpose of this consulting project is to analyze call statistics from the hotline with the use of the call detail report and develop an R shiny app to include the summary information of the hotline team. The following questions will be covered: 
- What percent of callbacks result in a conversation with an attorney? 
- What number and percent of calls are unanswered on average per day? 
- What number and percent of calls are completed on average per day? 
- On average, how long is the wait to speak with an attorney per day, for those who hold on the hotline and for those who choose a callback?
